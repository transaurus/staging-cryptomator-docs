# Vault Management

A *vault* is where your files are stored encrypted. For your operating system or other apps, a vault is a just a normal directory containing some encrypted files. Only Cryptomator can decrypt the vault's contents when you unlock it using a password.

## Remove Vaults[​](#remove-vaults "Direct link to Remove Vaults")

To remove a vault from the vault list, right click on a vault, and click remove. This is only possible if the vault is locked.

note

The vault is **not** deleted from your PC by removing it from the list. If you wish to permanently delete your encrypted files, you need to delete the vault directory using the file manager.

## Reorder Vaults[​](#reorder-vaults "Direct link to Reorder Vaults")

You can change the order of the vaults in the list by dragging them.

## Vault Options[​](#vault-options "Direct link to Vault Options")

Each vault has its own settings which can be customized under vault options. To open a vault's settings, select a vault, lock it, and click on `Vault Options`.

The options are divided across three categories:

1. General - Options not fitting in other categories.

You can select this option if the vault is unlocked as soon as Cryptomator starts.

* `Vault Name` - The name of the vault. *You can edit this field to rename the vault.*

* `Lock when idle for <n> minutes` - The vault will be locked automatically after the specified time of inactivity.

* `Unlock vault when starting Cryptomator` - On app start, Cryptomator will unlock the vault (otherwise the vault will remain locked).

* `After successful unlock`

  * `Do nothing` - Cryptomator will do nothing after unlocking the vault.
  * `Reveal Drive` - Opens the mount location using the default file manager (Windows Explorer, Finder, …).
  * `Ask` - Cryptomator will ask you what to do after unlocking the vault.

2. Mounting - Settings that manage how and where a vault is mounted.

note

The mount options depend on the selected [volume type](/zh-Hans/desktop/volume-type/.md).

3. Password - Here you can manage the vault's password and recovery key.

Take a look at the [Volume Type](/zh-Hans/desktop/volume-type/.md) and [Password And Recovery Key](/zh-Hans/desktop/password-and-recovery-key/.md) sections to understand how vault mounting and passwords work.
