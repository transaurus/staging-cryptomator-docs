# User & Group Management

Early Access

This feature is currently in **early access** and will be fully available in version 1.5.0.

Users and groups are managed directly in the Cryptomator Hub admin interface. As an administrator, you can create, edit, and delete users and groups, assign roles, and manage group memberships.

Access the user and group management from the navigation bar in the admin area.

## Roles[​](#roles "Direct link to Roles")

There are three roles in Cryptomator Hub:

| Role             | Description                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **user**         | Default role. Can open vaults and manage their own account.      |
| **admin**        | Can manage users and groups, view audit logs, and create vaults. |
| **create-vault** | Allows users to create new vaults. Inherited by the admin role.  |

Roles are assigned when creating or editing a user. The `user` role is assigned by default to all users.

### Create Vault Role[​](#create-vault-role "Direct link to Create Vault Role")

By default, only users with the `admin` role can create vaults. To allow other users to create vaults, assign the `create-vault` role to them when creating or editing the user.

## User Avatars[​](#user-avatars "Direct link to User Avatars")

Users can have profile pictures displayed throughout Hub (e.g., in vault member lists). As an administrator, you can set the profile picture URL when creating or editing a user.

The avatar can be provided as a URL to an image (e.g., `https://example.com/avatar.png`).

If no profile picture is set, a generated avatar based on the user's name will be displayed.

## External Identity Management[​](#enterprise-external-iam "Direct link to External Identity Management")

Enterprise Feature

Connecting external identity and access management (IAM) solutions is available as an Enterprise feature.

Visit [cryptomator.org](https://cryptomator.org/hub/) for more information about Enterprise features.

![Accessing Keycloak via Hub](/zh-Hans/img/hub/access-keycloak-link.png)

Connecting Cryptomator Hub to an external identity manager allows you to:

* Synchronize users and groups from LDAP or Active Directory
* Delegate authentication via OpenID Connect or SAML
* Keep your user management centralized in your existing IAM

You can access the Keycloak management interface from the admin section of Hub. There you can perform all user- and group-related tasks, such as [creating new users](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-creating-user_server_administration_guide), [deleting users](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-deleting-user_server_administration_guide) or [managing groups](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#proc-managing-groups_server_administration_guide).

Setting up LDAP synchronization is described in the [Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_ldap). For OpenID Connect and SAML, the Keycloak documentation provides [general information](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_identity_broker).

warning

Regardless of your IAM setup, your Hub instance always contains two system users: `admin` and `syncer`. **Do not edit or delete them!** These accounts are required for administration and synchronization tasks.
